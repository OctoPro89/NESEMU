NOTES:

The issue seems to NOT be in bus or nes2C02 clock. The issue is almost definitely NOT in the PPU implementation. Mapper, cart, and CPU suspected. Bus could also be the problem

Bus I believe has been completely replaced
nes2C02 I believe has also been completely replace
mapper_000 completely replaced
cartridge load replaced
cartridge cpu read/write and ppu read/write replaced

changelog:

mapper_000.cpp completely replaced
cartridge.cpp completely replaced
nes2C02.cpp: as far as I know completely replaced
bus.cpp: check again but I think completely replaced (may not be tho)
olc6502.cpp: completely replaced

TODO: debug main and emu.c

its probably something with those two as everything else has been replaced
